.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program that displays passages of the Bible on your terminal.
It can also play recorded audio tracks of certain passages,
through integration with the
.Xr mpg123 1
utility. While audio is playing, you can use the standard mpg123
controls: spacebar to pause/resume, comma to rewind, period
to fast-forward, etc. Read about the
.Fl C
option in mpg123's manual for more information.

The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width keyword
.It Fl a
Instead of displaying text passages, play a recorded audio track.

.Sx FILES ) .
.It Ev ESV_PLAYER
What MP3 player to use for playing audio, rather than using mpg123.
Using mpg123 is recommended over other players such as mpv, because
mpv's controls don't work well when started by another process
for some reason.
